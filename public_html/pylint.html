	<h1>Pylint Intro</h1>
	<a href="index.html">Return to Main Page</a>
	<div>
		Pylint is desgined to check your code in order to see if it meets the general <br>
		standards of how Python code should be written. If your code works well, but <br>
		looks messy and is nearly impossible to read, then you will have problems <br>
		in the future. Pylint will give you warnings on what is missing in your code <br>
		and adjustments that should be made to improve readability.

		In order to use Pylint, you must install it using:
		
		<pre>
                <code>
                pip install pylint
                </code>
                </pre>

		Afterwords you must go into the directory you want to run pylint on. From here <br>
		you can set which file you would like pylint to run on. For example, on the <br>
		following <a href="https://github.com/krojas64/calc2/tree/main">Github page</a>, <br>
		if we wanted to test the main file, we would run:

		<pre>
		<code>
		pylint calculator/main.py
		<code>
		</pre>

		Pylint is used so the terminal knows that we are running pylint on a file, and <br>
		the second argument is used to determine the filepath of the file to run pylint on. <br>
		Once run, the terminal will check the entire file and print out a list of errors <br>
		and warnings, explaining what is causing the error. This is where adjustments can be <br>
		made to your code, and as the number of errors decreases, your overall score will <br>
		also increase, indicating that your code is closer to the standard.
